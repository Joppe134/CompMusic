Track 1:
I made this beat about three years ago. It's designed for rapping and is inspired by the style of beats used by artists like Travis Scott. 
Track 2: 
Made with: https://stableaudio.com/generate
Prompt: I would like a minimal house track. It has to have some dark feeling to it. The track needs to bring you in a state of trance by combining call and response and the use of bell sounding instruments together with nice soothing synths. duration 2 to 4 minutes and it must be 4 to the floor rhythm.
